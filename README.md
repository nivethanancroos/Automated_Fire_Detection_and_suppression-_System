## Problem Statement
Current fire detection systems often struggle with false alarms, slow response times, and a lack of real-time alerts. A smarter system is needed to ensure quick detection, reduce false alarms, and provide instant notifications.

## Objective

To develop an IoT-based fire detection and suppression system that ensures early detection, real-time alerts, and automatic fire control to minimize risks and damage.

## Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: ESP32 (Dual-core processing, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
- Sensors:
  - DHT22: Temperature and humidity.
  - MQ-2: Smoke and combustible gas detection.
  - Flame Sensor: Infrared-based flame detection.
- IoT Protocols: MQTT or Firebase for real-time communication.
- Relay Module: Controls suppression systems (e.g., water pump).
- Power Supply: 5V DC adapter with voltage regulators.



## Features
1. Multi-Sensor Fusion: Reduces false positives by cross-verifying data from multiple sensors.
2. Real-Time Monitoring: Sends notifications to mobile apps or dashboards.
3. Automated Suppression: Activates sprinklers or pumps immediately upon fire detection.
4. Customizable Thresholds: Tailored for residential, commercial, or industrial environments.
5. Energy-Efficient Design: Low-power standby mode.
6. Error Handling: Alerts users if sensors malfunction or disconnect.



## Installation and Setup
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Connect components as per the circuit diagram.
   - Ensure power supply is stable.
2. Software Setup:
   - Install the Arduino IDE.
   - Add ESP32 libraries and configure the code.
   - Upload the code to ESP32.
3. IoT Configuration:
   - Set up an MQTT broker or Firebase for notifications.
   - Configure Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
4. Testing:
   - Simulate fire conditions to verify system responses.

## Conclusion

The Automated Fire Detection and Suppression System offers a reliable and cost-effective solution for early fire detection, real-time alerts, and automatic suppression, making it suitable for homes, offices, and industries.
