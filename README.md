# AUTOMATED FIRE DETECTION AND  SUPPRESSION SYSTEM

Problem Statement: Current fire detection systems have false alarms, slow response, and no real-time alerts. A smarter system is needed for quick detection, fewer false alarms, and instant notifications.

Objective: To develop an IoT-based fire detection and suppression system that ensures early detection, real-time alerts, and automatic fire control to minimize risks and damage.


## Components Used
 ESP32 Development 
 MQ-2 Smoke Sensor 
 DHT11 Sensor 
 Flame Sensor 
 Relay Module 
 Buzzer 
 Water Pump/Sprinkler 
 5V Power Supply 
 Breadboard 
 Jumper Wires 
 Resistors 
 voltage Regulator (Optional)


### Working Principle
Fire Detection – Sensors (temperature, smoke, and flame) continuously monitor the surroundings.

Fire Confirmation – The system checks multiple sensor readings to reduce false alarms.

Alert & Notification – A buzzer sounds locally, and an IoT-based alert is sent to a mobile app.

Automatic Suppression – A relay activates a water pump or sprinkler to put out the fire.

Remote Monitoring – Users can check and control the system through a mobile app.

Energy Saving – The system stays in low-power mode and activates only when needed.
